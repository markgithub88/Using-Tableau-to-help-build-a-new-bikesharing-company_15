Even though there's a big difference between bike riders in New York City and in Iowa this data can help us in creating a business plan in Iowa.

SUMMARY
I believe the overall reading of this data shows that most people are riding the bikes in New York to get to work or back home from work and most of the people riding are male.
SUGGESTIONS.  What's missing in these graphs is cost and company details like number of employees.  These would be very helpful to anyone trying to start a business.
